<p>The Pre-school employs four members of staff who are all experienced in working with children and hold Level 3 qualifications. The group encourages staff to attend ongoing training. Staff and regular volunteers all undergo various checks, including DBS to ensure suitability.</p>
<p>The sessions are staffed at the ratio of one staff member to four children under three years and one staff member to eight children over three years. In every session there is a Level 3 Supervisor and a named Deputy.</p>
<p>Often we have volunteer helpers and students on placement in the group, but they are not counted in the adult: child ratios.</p>
<p>On outings ratios are one member of staff to two unaccompanied children and if an outing takes place involving a small group we ensure that the safe ratios are maintained within the setting.</p>
